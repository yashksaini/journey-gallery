## Introduction
Journey Gallery is a web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with WebSQL for client-side data storage. It allows users to create a month-wise calendar where they can add images by clicking on specific dates. The website has two screens: one for the calendar view and another for displaying all the images in a gallery, organized date-wise.

## About the Project
Journey Gallery is designed to provide users with a platform to store and organize their cherished memories and work-related images. Users can create a month-wise calendar where they can add images representing their journey, be it personal or professional. The application offers both dark and light themes, allowing users to switch between the two. Users can expand images by clicking on them and have the option to download the images.

The primary purpose of this application is to help users store work screenshots and memorable moments, keeping track of good days to cherish later. Each image added to the calendar is stored using WebSQL, enabling the application to function offline and ensuring data privacy on the client side. 

The gallery view provides a date-wise organization of images, and users can expand any image by clicking on it for a closer look. Furthermore, users have the option to download and remove the images they've added, granting them complete control over their journey gallery. The intuitive user interface makes it easy for users to navigate and manage their images, creating a delightful experience to preserve and revisit their precious moments.
